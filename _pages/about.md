I am a third year PhD student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu) at Princeton University, 
and a member of the [Programming Languages Group](http://pl.cs.princeton.edu).
I am currently advised by [Zak Kincaid](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/).
My primary research interests are algebraic and geometric methods for program analysis and verification.
My current research project involves compositional and monotonic reasoning about  termination of programs.

I received a BS in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu), 
where I did research on interactive fault localization methods for software engineering, and parallel algorithms for genome assembly. 
I was fortunate to be advised by [Alex Orso](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/orso), [Srinivas Aluru](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~saluru), and [Vijay Vazirani](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~vazirani) (now at UC Irvine).
